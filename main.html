			The film's story was written by Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad, 
			who told him a story about Sivagami, a woman who carries a baby in her hand while crossing a river,
			and a few years later about Kattappa, which intrigued Rajamouli. His fascination with Mahabharata and the tales of Amar Chitra Katha and Chandamama further fueled his interest in the story.
